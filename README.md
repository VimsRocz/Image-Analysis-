### Key Features

1. **Smoothing Techniques**
   - **Gaussian Filter:** Implementations of Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and image smoothing. The `gauss_filter` function generates a Gaussian filter matrix based on a specified standard deviation, allowing users to control the level of smoothing.
   - **Median Filter:** Explore the `median_filter` function for applying a median filter to an image, effectively removing impulsive noise such as salt-and-pepper noise.

2. **Histogram Manipulation**
   - **Histogram Normalization:** The `histogram_normalization` function applies histogram normalization to a single-channel image, enhancing contrast and improving overall image quality. Users can adjust the outlier fraction parameter to customize the normalization process.
   - **Histogram Equalization:** Implement histogram equalization with the `histogram_equalization` function, redistributing pixel intensities to achieve a more balanced histogram and enhance image contrast.

3. **Gradient Computation**
   - **Derivative of Gaussian:** Calculate the derivative of Gaussian filters using the `derivative_of_gaussian` function. These filters are essential for computing image gradients, providing information about both magnitude and orientation.
   - **Laplacian of Gaussian:** Explore the `laplacian_of_gaussian` function to generate the Laplacian of Gaussian filter matrix, useful for edge detection and feature extraction.

4. **Visualization Tools**
   - **Visualizing Filters:** Easily visualize filter matrices for Gaussian, median, and Laplacian of Gaussian filters, aiding in understanding their spatial characteristics and effects on images.
   - **Gradient Visualization:** Visualize gradient magnitudes and orientations, as well as color-coded representations of gradient directions for intuitive interpretation of image gradients.
